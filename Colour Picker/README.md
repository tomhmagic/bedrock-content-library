# Colour Picker

## Colour Picker Model

### Install
Download the files or drag and drop them into your pack.

### How to Use
Summon the entities with `/scriptevent spawnpicker:[north/east/south/west]` while looking at the block you want them to spawn on top of.
Rotation is currently bugged; updates will be provided soon. You may need to execute to move them with a TP. You can use the "colour_picker_entity" family to target both entities.
Ensure there is at least a block behind both the Hue and the Picker Square. This is not placed for you.
